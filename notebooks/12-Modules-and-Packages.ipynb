    "One of the reasons Python is so versatile is the broad ecosystem of packages that add more specialized functionality on top of vanilla Python. These include built-in modules like `math` and `os`, third party packages like `numpy` and `xarray`, and modules and packages that you've created yourself. Loosely, a module is a single .py file and a package is a collection of modules (like in the exercise to follow after lunch). In this lecture we'll explain a bit about modules and packages, why you'd want to use them and how to access them."
